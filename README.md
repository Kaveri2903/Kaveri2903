# 👋 Hello there, I’m Kaveri Gadhe

📈 **Data Analyst | Curious Mind | Visual Storyteller**

I explore data to find patterns, insights, and answers. Whether it’s a spreadsheet or a SQL database, I enjoy diving into the numbers and turning them into something meaningful and useful.

### 🛠️ What I Work With
- **Languages & Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau
- **What I Do Best:**
  - Clean and organize messy data
  - Analyze trends and behavior
  - Build reports and dashboards that make sense
  - Ask the right questions (and find the answers)


### 🤝 Let’s Connect
If you like data or need help making sense of it, I’d love to chat!
