# 👋 Hello there, I’m Kaveri Gadhe

📈 **Data Analyst | Curious Mind | Visual Storyteller**

I explore data to find patterns, insights, and answers. Whether it’s a spreadsheet or a SQL database, I enjoy diving into the numbers and turning them into something meaningful and useful.

### 🛠️ What I Work With
🔹 **Business Intelligence & Dashboards**  
I craft sleek and dynamic dashboards in **Power BI** that not only look good but speak clearly. KPIs, trends, and drill-throughs – all tailored to decision-making.

🔹 **Data Analysis & Exploration**  
I use **SQL** to extract and explore data from databases, **Excel** to analyze and organize information, and **Power BI** to build clear, interactive reports that help support decision-making — I ask the right questions and find answers in the data.

🔹 **SQL Mastery**  
I write efficient, scalable queries to pull, clean, and analyze data across diverse databases.

🔹 **Automation & Reporting**  
Routine tasks? Let’s automate them. Manual dashboards? Not anymore. I use Excel formulas, macros, and BI tools to save time and boost accuracy.

- **What I Do Best:**
  - Clean and organize messy data
  - Analyze trends and behavior
  - Build reports and dashboards that make sense
  - Ask the right questions (and find the answers)

## 🧠 Currently Leveling Up
- Mastering **Advanced DAX** for better Power BI modeling  
- Enhancing **storytelling through visual design**  
- Deepening my knowledge in **SQL optimization** and data modeling


## 🌍 Let’s Connect
I'm always excited to collaborate, brainstorm ideas, or just talk data.
